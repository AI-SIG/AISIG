# Mensa South Africa AI SIG
This repository serves as a central point for coordinating Mensa SA AI SIG group activities. 

## Getting started
1. You will probably need to know how to use [git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). More elaborate tutorials may be found on [bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials). If all else fails, use the GUI.
1. For showcasing our projects, use github or [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/).
1. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) has loads of data sets and competitions. Forking a kernel is a great way to learn - almost as great as writing your own kernel. This is more on the data science side of things, but it overlaps with Machine Learning and AI. Who knows? Perhaps we can form Mensa SA teams and win one of their competitions. Cha ching!
1. Kaggle also has [Programming and Machine Learning courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview), for various levels. They're currently still developing the courses, so you can go from novice to intermediate but they'll probably have advanced course content eventually.
1. Ask one of your friendly Mensa committee members for access to the WhatsApp group. If that fails, you can also ask me.

## Useful AI links
1. [What is AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/)? This link also explains the difference between AI and Machine Learning.
1. [Eliezer Yudkowski](http://yudkowsky.net/) is an AI evangelist who has loads of fascinating blog posts on AI and related topics. Also on some unrelated topics.
1. The [Singularity](https://singularityhub.com/) is near!


## Useful Machine Learning links
1. The [CIS page of the IEEE](https://cis.ieee.org/) page.
1. Coursera has a legendary [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) that is archived by now. It will teach you more theory than you probably need, but despite that it's not too maths-heavy.
1. Google has a [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/).
1. [Machine learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/).
1. [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) courses and tutorials from [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) and his students.

## Useful Data Science links
1. [Super Data Science](https://www.superdatascience.com/).
1. [Machine learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/). Yes, this covers both machine learning and data science.
1. You can do the [Open Source Data Science Masters Degree](http://datasciencemasters.org/)

## You are welcome to discuss Roko's Basilisk here
Feel free to discuss [grey goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo), the [Nibiru cataclysm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibiru_cataclysm) and even [Roko's Basilisk](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk). This is a special interest group and not a tyranny.
